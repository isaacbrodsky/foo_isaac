# foo_isaac

Isaac's foobar2000 components.

| Component | Description
| --------- | -----------
| foo_midicontrol | Control foobar2k playback using the Korg NanoKontrol 2
| foo_metadataexport | Export metadata of all tracks in a playlist to JSON
| foo_hotkeys | (Missing here) Global hotkey control of foobar2k

The components are mostly controlled via context menus - remapping MIDI controls,
and so on, are not available. (It's assumed you would recompile if you need to
change that.)

You will naturally need the foobar2000 SDK to compile this repository.
